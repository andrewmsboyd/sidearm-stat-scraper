# sidearm-stat-scraper

`sidearm-stat-scraper` is a simple Python script intended for use in scraping sports statistical data from websites implemented by [Sidearm Sports](https://www.sidearmsports.com/). Many American universities use Sidearm's product for their athletic websites.

The project was originally created to scrape baseball statistics from Tarleton State University's athletics site in order to perform analysis on current players.

**At this time, it is not known how universal the application of this script can be, since it is still in early stages of development and has only been tested on Tarleton's site.**
